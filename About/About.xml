--- Original Description ---
Handy inspector tab for checking the status of your power network.

Planned additions include line graphs for historical power values, warnings for when power consumption exceed power production, warnings for when battery storage is too low to sustain a network over night, and various doodads and stats to make power network maintainence easier.
